# Strategies for Derivations

## Top-Down Strategy
By examining the premises first, we can get to the conclusion
- See if the conclusion you are looking for is embedded in the premises as a component part of a compound statement
- If so, think about how you can *eliminate* the other part of the compiound statement
- If you cannot immediately use elimination, think about *sub-goals* and relevant sub-derivations you can use to get to that point

## Bottom-Up Startegy
If the conclusion is not immediately recognizable from premises or parts of premises, we'll have to identify sub-goals in order to get to our premises.
- Identify the main connective of the conclusion. Think about the introduction rule for that connective, and set up sub-goals
- Repeat as often as needed until the proof can evidently be proved by using the Top-Down strategy

**Remember:** If the main connective of the conclusion is either a conditional or a negation, you will likely need at least one sub-derivation.

## Multiple sub-derivations
You can have both nested sub-derivations as well as multiple subderivations.

As we nest deeper into multiple sub-derivations, the scope line accuracy becomes increasingly important!
