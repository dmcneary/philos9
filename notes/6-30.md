# Natural Deduction in Sentential Logic


Natural deduction involves using a set of valid (i.e truth preserving) rules of inference to derive conclusions from premises.  If you start with all true premises and use any one of these rules any number of times, the conclusions you arrive at are guaranteed to be true.

This method is more difficult to learn than the truth-table method, but it is ultimately more efficient.

## Valid Rules of Inference
A valid rule of inference is a rule for drawing conclusions from premises such that if your premises are true, the conclusion will have to be true.

### &sup; ("Horseshoe") Elimination (**Modus Ponens**)
In a if/then statement, if the antedecent is always true, then the consequent will always also be true. In other words, if the antecedent of the conditional is stated as another premise, then the consequent will be true.

Examples:
1. P &sup; Q
2. P  
_-_----------------------
3. Q

***

1. ~(P & R) &sup; ~Q
2. ~P v ~R  
_-_----------------------
3. ~Q

### & (And) Elimination
If we have a true premise which consists of two statements connected by "and," then we can conclude that both statements are also true.

Examples:
1. P & Q
2. P  
_-_----------------------
3. Q

## Derivations
We can use these rules of inference to prove an argument without the need to construct a truth table, in a process called **derivation:**

James and Sarah are both over 21. If Sarah is over 21, she can legally drink. Therefore, Sarah can legally drink.

1. J & S
2. S &sup; D  
_-_----------------------
3. S (1 &E)
4. D (2, 3 &sup;E)

### Warnings
- When using &E, the premises you are using to infer the conclusion must be connected with "&:"
1. P &sup; (Q & Z)  
_-_----------------------
2. Z (1 &E) **WRONG!**

- When using &sup;E, the conditional premise must have a true antecedent, usually provided as another premise, in order for the consequent to be used in inferring the conclusion:
1. G &sup; Z  
_-_----------------------
2. Z (1 &sup;E) **WRONG!**

- Reverse conditional: we cannot prove an antecedent from its consequent using a conditional (though we can in a biconditional):

1. G &sup; Z
2. Z  
_-_----------------------
2. G (1, 2 &sup;E) **WRONG!**

## More Rules
### & Introduction
If we have two (or more) true premises, we can join them using &:

1. J
2. S  
_-_----------------------
3. J & S (1, 2 &I)

### &or; Elimination
Similar to &E, if part of an &or; premise is false, then the other part must be true:

1. J &or; S
2. ~S  
_-_----------------------
3. J (1, 2 &or;E)

### &or; Introduction
This gets a little wild; because only one part of an &or; case needs to be true for the entire case to be true, we can make some interesting claims:

1. J  
_-_----------------------
2. J &or; S (1, &or;I)

### &equiv; Introduction
If we have two conditionals, where the consequent of one is the antecedent of the other, and vice versa, then we can relate the two as equivalent:

1. J &sup; S
2. S &sup; J  
_-_----------------------
3. J &equiv; S (1, 2 &equiv;I)

### &equiv; Elimination
Conversely, we can go the other way and derive a conditional from a biconditional:

1. J &equiv; S  
_-_----------------------
2. S &sup; J (1, 2 &equiv;E)

### Reiteration
Simply restating a fact - this will come in handy when performing **sub-derivations:**

1. J  
_-_----------------------
2. J (1, R)
