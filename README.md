PHILOS9 Notes
===
This repository contains a Github Pages deployment for the presentation of my notes in PHILOS9 - Symbolic Logic, taken in Summer 2021 at Santa Monica College.

This serves as an exercise in using Jekyll and Github Pages to generate a website using only Markdown files.

Notes for this course are listed in the 'index.md' file, which serves at the home page for the site.
